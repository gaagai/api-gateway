# api-gateway
Node.js API Gateway. Designed to be simple and scalable.

This is a simple&fast reverse-proxy on the base of https://github.com/http-party/node-http-proxy which logs all requests to long term storage for later analysis.

Designed for maximum hardware efficiency, and wicked fast analytics queries, thus Clickhouse is used instead of Elastic or Mongo.
Clickhouse is very effective in terms of performance of analytical queries, uses best-in-class compression, and has SQL support out of the box.
